# Troubleshooting
## Not turning on

1. Check the power indicator lights: if it's off, then the battery is drained. Charge it.
2. Some models have a protective sticker at the bottom of the microSD card that makes the connection unstable. Removing it will make connections a lot better.

If the lights are on:
1. The microSD card is loose. Gently push the card in until the screen lights up. Or if you want to be sure, connect the SCI-CALC to your computer via a data usb-c cable and open the serial monitor (baud rate 115200). 
2. The OLED screen module is misaligned. Check the pogo pins on the left side. If misaligned, loosen the screws on the top plate holding the module down, and push the module to the left until the pogo pins are touching the pads
